%% Dynamics update example (no conversion from ft/min to ft/s)
-- Step 0 --
h = 133;
h_dot = -19.5;
a = 0;
COC --> CL1500

-- Step 1 --
h = 133-19.5 = 113.5
h_dot = 19.5;
a = 7g/24;
CL1500 --> CL1500

-- Step 2 --
 - Violation of NMAC
h = 113.5 - 19.5 < 100. What are we doing wrong in our implementation?
